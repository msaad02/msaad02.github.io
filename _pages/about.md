# Hello!

I'm an aspiring PhD student looking to study NLP. Currently I'm at <a href="https://www2.brockport.edu/">SUNY Brockport</a> studying Math and Computer Science. I've spent a lot of time recently thinking about how to make language models more efficient and robust. Some topics of interest to me are: language model evaluation metrics, quantization, memory efficient training techniques, and applications of NLP to other fields. 

I'm currently working on my honors thesis, BrockportGPT, which uses a wide array of techniques to create a chatbot for my school SUNY Brockport. Domain specific chatbots have become increasingly popular recently, and we hope to contribute to the field by  offering a generalizable framework for creating domain specific chatbots. See our [blog](/projects/brockportgpt/) page for more information.
