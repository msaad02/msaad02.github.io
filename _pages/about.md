# Hello!

I'm a student at <a href="https://www2.brockport.edu/">SUNY Brockport</a> studying Math and Computer Science. 

I'm currently working on my honors thesis, BrockportGPT, which uses a wide array of techniques to create a chatbot for my school SUNY Brockport. Domain specific chatbots have become increasingly popular recently, and we hope to contribute to the field by  offering a generalizable framework for creating domain specific chatbots. See our [blog](/projects/brockportgpt/) page for more information.

If you have any questions or comments, you can find me at msaad1 at brockport dot edu
