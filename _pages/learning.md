# Learning

*I am on winter break right now, so I hope to get a lot of learning done! I hope to make significant progress on everything below*

---

**Finish my honors thesis**, BrockportGPT, and work on getting it published (see Projects tab for more info).

---

I am participating in [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)! Check out my solutions [here](https://github.com/msaad02/AdventOfCode2023). I'm a little behind right now due to end of semester deadlines, but I'll catch up soon!

---

I'm currently learning more about the following topics:

- Differential programming ([pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) mainly)
- Memory efficient techniques for training and inference of LMs (LoRA, GPTQ, etc.) on a deeper level
- How to use [gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) to make interactive demos of my models
- Website building (this website specifically)
- Open model experimentation (would like to try out Mixtral, Phi-1.5, and Orca 2 specifically)
