For winter break 2023, I'm working on the following:

1. **Finish my honors thesis**, BrockportGPT, and work on getting it published (see Projects tab)

---

Some things I'd like to learn/am working on learning:

- Differential programming ([pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) mainly)
- Memory efficient techniques for training and inference of LMs (LoRA, GPTQ, etc.) in the math sense
- Building out this website
- Open model experimentation (would like to try out Mixtral, Phi-1.5, and Orca 2 specifically)
