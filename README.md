# My Personal Website

This uses a Jekyll theme, Minimal Mistakes. For more information see [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), or this [cheat sheet](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-11-Minimal_Mistakes_Cheat_Sheet/).

## Local Development

Mostly as a note to myself to remember...

To run locally, use `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` and navigate to `localhost:4000`.
