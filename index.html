    Hello! I'm an aspiring PhD student looking to study NLP. Currently I'm at <a href="https://www2.brockport.edu/">SUNY Brockport</a> studying Math and Computer Science. I've spent a lot of time recently thinking about how to make language models more efficient and robust. Some topics of interest to me are: language model evaluation metrics, quantization, memory efficient training techniques, and applicaations of NLP to other fields.
