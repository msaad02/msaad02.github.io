    Hi, I'm an aspiring CS PhD student. I'm interested in language modeling,
    specifically ways they can be made more efficient and accessible. However,
    I have a broad range of interests in the field, and I'm actively looking to
    learn more. If you have any book/paper recommendations, or other resources
    to learn please contact me!
